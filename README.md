# React with Redux
A simple counter created to learn a little more about Redux toolkit.

This project is a simple counter created to learn about [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) and how your state
management works.

I also used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to create the react application.

Feel free to clone this project and take a look at its structure. Any doubts, please, contact me. :D
